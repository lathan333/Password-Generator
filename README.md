# Password-Generator
 This JavaScript code implements a random password generator. Users can specify the length of the password and choose whether to include numbers and special characters. The generatePassword function takes these parameters and constructs a password by randomly selecting characters from predefined character sets. The generated password is returned by the function. An example usage demonstrates how to generate a password with specific criteria and prints it to the console. The code can be customized further for different character sets or additional password generation rules.
